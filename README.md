# CTF-Sources

This repository contains source code and artifacts from various CTF challenges Iâ€™ve participated in.  
The main purpose is to keep them organized for future reference, practice, and writeups.

ðŸ‘‰ Writeups are published on my blog: [https://blog.hitc.at](https://blog.hitc.at)

---

## Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a specific CTF or challenge.
- Code, notes, and exploit scripts are kept as-is from the competition (may be messy).
- Some challenges include additional cleanup or improvements after the event.
